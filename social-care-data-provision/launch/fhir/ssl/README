This folder contains a "private" key necessary to configure a HTTPS server. This file would normally be held securely.
 
The key is provided here so that the FHIR Appliance can run HTTPS endpoints:

** Evidently these keys are self-signed by a "fake" CA and are not secret or secure **
** The private key and server certificate should only ever be used for development/demonstration purposes only **
** You may prefer to replace all of the keys and certificates with your own self-signed set **
