This folder contains the corresponding "private" keys and certs which would normally be held securely and used for:
 
 - JWT token signing
 - Mutal TLS Client authentication
 
The certificates and keys are provided here so that the application can make JWT and mutal TLS authenticated requests to the FHIR Appliance:

** Evidently these keys are self-signed by a "fake" CA and are not secret or secure **
** The keys are for internal developer demo purposes only and should not be used with an externally connected system **
** You may prefer to replace all of the keys and certificates in this "auth" area with your own **
